This histogram is heavily skewed to the right, with most of the data clustered towards lower values. There seems to be a peak around the $3,000,000 mark.
The shadowgram shows a lot of the same things that the histogram does, also being extremely skewed to the right. There is only one modal peak towards the very left of the graph. 
The boxplots show that the quartiles, ranges, and medians for most of the colleges is very similar. But, Alabama and Clemson have a much greater range and median than the rest of the schools, making the rest of the schoolsâ€™ plots look very small.
The descriptive stats back up the boxplots, in that Alabama and Clemson have the greatest ranges and medians. They also have the greatest two sample arithmetic means, and those two values are much greater than every other school's SAM. The Alabama data also had the smallest absolute value sample skewness of every school, and every school had a positive sample skewness.
