We are doing a quasi-experiment, as we are randomly sampling draftees from our 17 schools. Our primary response is the value of a drafteeâ€™s rookie contract. Our only factor of interest is the school that the draftee attended. We are using an ANCOVA model, so we have a covariate, and that will be the logarithmic transformation of the pick number. We are using a block, and blocking by the year of the draft. Our null hypothesis in question is that the college which a draftee went to does not have a statistically significant impact on the value of their contract. Our alternate hypothesis is that the college which a draftee went to does have a statistically significant impact on the value of their rookie contract. We are controlling the MEER at .15 because the research that we are doing would not harm anyone if we made a Type 1 error.
